        <p>This is just a stupid paragraph. You don't have to read it, but if you do thats fine. I'm just saying you don't HAVE to read it, matter of fact you don't HAVE to do ANYTHING.. but it's completely up to you though, read it, not read it, it doesn't matter oh you're reading it and you just finished reading the whole thing! kudos to you, weldone! you're a taented reader</p>
